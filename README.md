## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Tried to use TailwindCSS again after quite some time. It is rather easy to use but can be quite messy and not very reuseable.

### Continued development

Continue practicing TailwindCSS and learn how to make it reuseable.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Pretty much everything about TailwindCSS can be learned from here.
